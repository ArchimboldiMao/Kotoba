### Create app identifier on developer portal at:

https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list

* Register a new Identifier

Platform: iOS
App ID Prefix: Pick one with (Team ID)

Description: Kotoba
Bundle ID: com.iconfactory.Kotoba

Capabilities: Select iCloud, Include CloudKit support (requires Xcode 6)

> Continue

If you get an error about bundle ID not being available, go Back and change it to something like com.iconfactory.internal.Kotoba, then try again. You'll need to change the Xcode project to use the same bundle ID. You'll lose all previous word history at this point, because the words are stored in the app with the old bundle identifier. Yay provisioning.

> Register

### Update Xcode settings

* Select the Target "Kotoba" and then the "Signing & Capabilities" tab

* Click the + icon to add iCloud.

* Under iCloud, the only checkbox you need is for "Key-value storage"
