# Kotoba App Store description

Kotoba (Japanese for “word” or “language”) is for people who love words.

Just type or dictate a word to check the definition, and Kotoba will automatically save it for easy reference later. You can even collect foreign words from any of the dictionaries supported by iOS, for language study or travel.
